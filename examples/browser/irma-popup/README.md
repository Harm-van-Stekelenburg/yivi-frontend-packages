# Browser IRMA popup example

This package is an example for how to use the `irma-popup` plugin in the
web browser. See the source of `index.js` and `public/index.html` for how we use
the plugin.

You can run this example by running these commands in this directory:

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

Then the public directory of this example can simply be hosted using an HTTP
server to run the example. You can for example use `serve` for this:

```bash
npm install serve
`npm bin`/serve ./public
```
