# Browser IRMA console example

This package is an example for how to use the `irma-console` plugin in the
web browser. See the source of `index.js` for how we use the plugin.

You can run this example by running these commands in this directory:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The demo application will then run on the URL mentioned in the terminal output
(usually http://localhost:8080/).
