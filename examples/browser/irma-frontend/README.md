# Browser IRMA frontend example

This package is an example for how to use the `irma-frontend` wrapper in the
web browser. See the source of `index.html` for how we use the wrapper.

You can run this example by running these commands in this directory:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The demo application will then run on the URL mentioned in the terminal output
(usually http://localhost:8080/).
